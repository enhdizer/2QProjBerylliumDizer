			<p>feel free to experiment with different styles of shading and palettes for your art. at first, your style may not be as developed as you like, but as always it's important to know that nothing starts out perfectly. keep working on your art and try to get it where you want it to be.</p>

			<p>in my experience, the best way to improve is to join art discord servers and post your work there. direct feedback is very helpful and you can also check out other people's art in the process.</p>
